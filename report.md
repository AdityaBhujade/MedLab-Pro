# MedLab Pro: Laboratory Management System

## 1. Project Overview
MedLab Pro is a full-stack Laboratory Management System designed to streamline the workflow of medical laboratories. It enables efficient management of patients, test results, analytics, and reporting, with a modern, user-friendly interface and robust backend.

---

## 2. Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (React Router, Tailwind CSS/vanilla CSS)
- **Backend:** Python Flask (REST API)
- **Database:** SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Other:** LocalStorage (for some analytics), HTML2PDF.js (for PDF report generation)

---

## 3. Features Implemented

### Authentication
- Modern login page (demo: any email + password 6+ chars)
- Logout functionality

### Navigation & Layout
- Responsive sidebar with navigation links (Dashboard, Patients, Tests, Reports, Analytics)
- Sidebar hidden on login/logout, visible elsewhere
- Mobile-friendly sidebar with hamburger toggle

### Patient Management
- Add, edit, delete, and search patients
- Inline editing and deletion with confirmation
- Gender badges and referral tracking

### Test Management
- Add and view test results for patients
- Each test result includes value, unit, and reference range
- Test results linked to patients

### Reports
- Generate professional laboratory reports for selected patients
- Select company details from a dropdown (populated from backend)
- Reports display patient info, test results, and company header
- Print and download reports as PDF
- Track number of reports generated

### Analytics
- Dashboard with key stats: total patients, tests, reports generated, tests today
- Analytics page with:
  - Age and gender distribution
  - Test analytics (normal/abnormal results, completion rate)
  - Trends (tests per month)
  - Recent activity (patients, tests, reports)

### Company Management
- Company details stored in backend (name, address, phone, email)
- Company dropdown in report generation, with details shown in the report header

## 4. Backend API Endpoints

- **Patients:**
  - `GET /api/patients` — List all patients
  - `POST /api/patients` — Add a new patient
  - `PUT /api/patients/<id>` — Update patient
  - `DELETE /api/patients/<id>` — Delete patient

- **Tests:**
  - `GET /api/tests` — List all test results
  - `POST /api/tests` — Add test result
  - `GET /api/tests/patient/<patient_id>` — Get test results for a patient

- **Companies:**
  - `GET /api/companies` — List all companies
  - `POST /api/companies` — Add a company

---

## 5. Implementation Highlights
- **Conditional Sidebar Rendering:** Sidebar is hidden on login/logout using React Router's `useLocation`.
- **Patient List:** Search, edit, and delete are all handled inline for a seamless UX.
- **Report Generation:**
  - Fetches patient and test data from backend
  - Company details are dynamically loaded and displayed
  - Reports can be printed or downloaded as PDF
- **Analytics:**
  - Uses backend data for all calculations
  - LocalStorage is used to track report generation count
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Sidebar toggles on mobile
  - Layout adapts to screen size

---

## 6. How to Run

1. **Backend:**
   - Install dependencies (`Flask`, `SQLAlchemy`, etc.)
   - Run the Flask app (`python app.py`)

2. **Frontend:**
   - Install dependencies (`npm install`)
   - Start the React app (`npm start`)

3. **Usage:**
   - Login with any email and password (6+ chars)
   - Use the sidebar to navigate between modules
   - Add patients, tests, generate reports, and view analytics

---

## 7. Functionality Yet to Be Added

- **Authentication:**
  - Real authentication and user roles (currently demo only)
  - Session management and protected routes

- **Company Management:**
  - UI for adding/editing/deleting companies (currently only backend)

- **Test Management:**
  - More granular test categories and templates
  - Bulk import/export of test results

- **Reports:**
  - Email/WhatsApp integration for sending reports
  - Customizable report templates

- **Analytics:**
  - More advanced charts and export options
  - Filtering by date, patient, or test type

- **General:**
  - Audit logs and activity tracking
  - Deployment to cloud and production database (e.g., PostgreSQL)

## 8. Summary

MedLab Pro demonstrates:
- Full-stack development (React + Flask + SQLAlchemy)
- RESTful API design and consumption
- Modern, responsive UI/UX
- State management and conditional rendering in React
- Real-world features: search, edit, delete, analytics, reporting
- Clean code, modular structure, and best practices

**Ready for further enhancements and production deployment!**
